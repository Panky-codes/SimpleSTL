# SimpleSTL
A simple C++ STL code to understand the basic concepts going underneath the implementation. 
There are so many FOSS STL implementations available online which are more optimized and covers all the edge cases. 

But the intention of this repository is to keep the implementation basic and use modern C++ concepts so that beginners can understand
STL, and in that process also learn some modern C++ concepts. 
I have also included as many test cases as possible along with static analysis tool such as clang tidy and cppcheck to maintain quality.

This repository is intended for educational puporses, for me and for others. 

Constructive criticism is always welcomed. Feel free to create an issue if you spot a bug.
